##Who I have worked with: Xin Zhang

##I have implemented:

 We two discussed the thoughts of the solution to the problem together and implemented all code respectively. So I implemented MATIntro.c, MATInit.c, MATOp.c.

##QuestionsA
###Solutions:
1. * At ljmp $PROT_MODE_CSEG, $protcseg.
   * Switch happened when execute the movl %eax, %ebx. 

2. * Bootloaders' last instruction: jmp	 *%edx 
   * Kernal's first instruction:cmpl   $MULTIBOOT_BOOTLOADER_MAGIC, %eax 
3. At kern/init/entry.S, .globl
4. The boot loader finds and reads the kernel from the hard disk by directly accessing the IDE disk device registers via the x86's special I/O				instructions.

We two implemented easy part of code separately. Some difficult functions are written by us together.
